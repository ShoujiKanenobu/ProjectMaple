##Thoughts on the project

I learned a lot doing this project, most specifically about optimization and working with a client. There is a lot I would change if I did this project again, most specifically to do with project architecture. Because of the nature of the deadlines, refactoring wasn't a viable option, leading to very messy code. After a lot of studying when things failed however, I am confident I wont make the same mistakes.

Cheers!
